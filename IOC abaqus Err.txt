There was a great problem at first regarding abaqus crashing after trying to
section using the section by datum Plane 
the problem was that I used to define an assembly first and then use that for
making the sections and It all caused the "GUI detected error while waiting for
ipc connection to close." Error 
it has nothing to do with the graphics and its just a problem of programming 
if it runs interactively then it should run by scripts
this is an error of abaqus regarding the Scripts.
